Thoughts on a units parser
==========================


Terminology
===========

The following is taken from ISO 30-0 (as described by wikipedia as the
actual document is not free), descriptions on www.bipm.org and
physics.nist.org, and the wikipedia article on dimensional analysis. 

Examples:

  (1) The wavelength is λ = 350 nm
  (2) The energy is E = 9.7 EJ 


(Physical) quantity 
	  =   One of kinetic energy, wavelength, frequency, height, ...

	      "Quantity" is used in two senses: in the general sense,
	      as "a property that may be quantitified", and in the
	      particular sense, as "a quantified property". The
	      distinction is that between "kinetic energy" as a
	      concept and "the kinetic energy of X" as a property of
	      X.

	      The property represented by λ in example (1), or E in
	      example (2), is a physical quantity.

Kind of quantity
     	  =   One of energy, power, force, length, mass, time, electric
	      charge, ...

	      Quantities fall into sets of mutually comparable kinds,
	      the definition of which is somewhat subjective. For
	      example, wavelength, diameter, and height all fall under
	      the general kind "length". See the International
	      Vocabulary of Metrology.

Dimension =   One of a chosen set of kinds of quantity.

 	      Dimensions form a *group*: the set of dimensions is
	      closed under multiplication, which is associative;
	      inverses exist; and there is an identity
	      ("dimensionless").

	      A *basis* for the group of dimensions used in mechanics
	      is the set: {mass, length, time}. For electromagnetism,
	      add charge (or current). For thermodyamics, add
	      temperature. For relativity, remove length.

Value	  =   A quantification of a physical quantity. 

	      In example (1), the value of λ is 350 nm. The value of a
	      quantity can be represented by a number and unit.

Numerical value = 
	      The value of a quantity expressed in a particular
	      unit. In example (1), the numerical value is 350.

Unit = 	      A particular physical quantity, used to provide a reference for
	      a value. For SI units, includes the prefix. Examples
	      are: kg, namometre, yard, millisecond, toe, exajoule, ...

Base unit =  (SI). One of {kilogram, metre, second, ampere, kelvin,
     	     mole, candela}. The SI units in terms of which all other
     	     units are derived.

Derived unit = 
	     (SI). Any SI unit that is not a derived unit. 

SI Prefix =  One of yocto, zepto, atto, ..., deci, deca, ..., exa,
   	     zetta, yotta.

kilogram  =  About to be the bane of our lives, since it is the only
	     SI base unit with a prefix in its name.



Grammar
=======


BNF for SI [Incomplete musings]
-------------------------------

(I presume this could be done with a regular grammar and expressed
with a regular expression. At the moment doesn't allow "/" )

<value>	    = <number> " "+ <unit>

<unit> 	    = ε | <unit-part> ((" " | "·") <unit-part>)*

<unit-part> = <si-prefix> <symbol> <power> ; no intervening space

<si-prefix> = "da" | "h" | "k" | "M" | "G" | "T" | "P" | "E" | "Z" | "Y" |
	       "d"   "c" | "m" | "µ" | "n" | "p" | "f" | "a" | "z" | "y"


<symbol>     = "m" | "g" | "s" | [and so on...]
